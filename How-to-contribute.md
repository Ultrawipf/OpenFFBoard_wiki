Being an open source project you are allowed and encouraged to submit issues, bug fixes and features.

### Simplified steps for contribution:
1. Clone/Fork the projects master branch
2. Make your changes and create a commit (If it requires GUI features to be changed it is recommended to do the same with the [configurator repo](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard-configurator) or if its just a small change detail what the effect is and request a change)
3. Create a pull request for your fork against master and describe your contribution in a detailed way. What bug does it fix? Which feature is added?
4. Wait for approval and append requested changes to your branch
5. Your code gets squash merged if approved

### Release workflow
Changes should be added in the CHANGELOG.md file.
This will be used to generate release notes.
A tagged commit (v1.x.x) will trigger an automatic release. A tag with a "-" (v1.x.x-beta) generates a prerelease.

### Submodules
The configurator is an important part of the project and should be kept up to date with any changes required to support a firmware and the submodule should if possible point to a commit that works with the corresponding firmware version.
Pull the submodules with `git submodule update --init`.

### Branches
If you directly push a branch to the project as a developer your branch name should contain your username or the type of feature. Like `ultrawipf/warpspeed` or `feature/pwmdriver`.
Set your git author name correctly before committing.

### Code style
The code should follow the same style as the other parts of the project and you should use easy to understand comments for complex statements and new functions.

### Flash storage
If you require a variable to be stored in flash check the eeprom emulation functions and choose an address according to `scripts/memory_map.csv` and add it to the list in [`scripts/memory_map.csv`](../../Firmware/scripts/memory_map.csv). 

The script `scripts/generate_memory.py` is used to generate `eeprom_addresses.c` and `eeprom_addresses.h` from the csv file to keep track of used addresses and automatically set the right defitions.

In general you should use a block of addresses per class and use the space efficiently. If you have 5 bools and an 8 bit int to store don't use 6 full addresses but pack them into a single uint16_t.
